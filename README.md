# Blackdagger CART YAML Files
This repository consists of YAML files that are created to be used in [Blackdagger](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger) tool.


With these YAML files, we aim to provide you example CART actions that are easy to run and understand, show you the format and mechanisms of Blackdagger YAML files and give you inspiration and ideas to modify these files or create new ones for your CART needs. You can find the descriptions of each step in the YAML files. 

# Features Provided With These YAMLs
- Scanning targets for:
    - XSS
    - SSRF
    - CORS Misconfiguration
    - LFI and
    - Open Redirect vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning with reconnaissance and testing accessibility

We will frequently update these YAMLs with support for more kinds of CART actions and abilities. Stay tuned!

# Using These YAMLs in Blackcart
Specifically for CART and DevSecOps needs, we created a Dockerfile called [Blackcart](https://github.com/ataseren/blackcart).
Blackcart is a powerful Docker container designed for Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART) and DevSecOps pipelines. It integrates a comprehensive suite of security tools into a containerized environment, enabling continuous security testing and proactive threat mitigation. 
Blackdagger is also integrated in Blackcart. Therefore, we advise you to use these YAML files in Blackdagger integrated in Blackcart to benefit from the Blackcart's features and perform your CART tasks easily.
